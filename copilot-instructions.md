# Copilot Guidelines for this Repository

Please follow these coding guidelines when generating COBOL code:

- Indent code with **4 spaces**.  
- Use **descriptive variable names** in **UPPERCASE with underscores** (e.g., `TOTAL_SUM`).  
- Avoid abbreviations in variable and procedure names.  
- Add **comments** to explain the purpose of complex code blocks.  
- Avoid the use of **GO TO** statements.  
- Place all program logic inside the **PROCEDURE DIVISION**.
